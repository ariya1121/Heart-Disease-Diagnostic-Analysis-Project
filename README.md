Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis

Introduction
This repository contains the Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis project. 
The goal of this project is to develop a diagnostic model that can predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes.
This project is part of my data analysis and machine learning studies and aims to provide insights into the factors contributing to heart disease.

Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

HDDA Dashboard.xlsx: An Excel file with the dashboard created for visualizing and interacting with the data.
HDDA Dataset.csv: The dataset used for the analysis, containing patient information and medical attributes.
Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis.pdf: A detailed PDF report of the analysis and findings.
Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis.pptx: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project and its outcomes.
Project 10_ Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis.pdf: A detailed PDF of Project details).

Dataset
The dataset used in this project, HDDA Dataset.csv, includes the following features:

Age
Sex
Chest Pain Type
Resting Blood Pressure
Serum Cholesterol
Fasting Blood Sugar
Resting Electrocardiographic Results
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
Exercise Induced Angina
ST Depression
Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment
Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
Thalassemia

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis.ipynb

Methodology
The project involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data through visualization and summary statistics.
Feature Selection: Identifying the most significant features for predicting heart disease.
Model Development: Building and training machine learning models using various algorithms.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Interpretation: Analyzing the results and understanding the key predictors of heart disease.

Visualization
The HDDA Dashboard.xlsx file provides an interactive dashboard for visualizing the data and model predictions. 
It includes various charts and graphs to help understand the distribution of the data and the relationships between different features.

Conclusion
This project successfully developed a diagnostic model for predicting heart disease. 
The analysis highlighted several important factors that contribute to heart disease, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals.
